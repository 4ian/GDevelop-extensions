Useful for dialogue scenes or visual novels.\n\nAdd the behavior to a Text object (or BBText object) and choose the interval between characters.\n\n* When the text changes, the automatic typing starts again from the beginning with the new text.\n* You can change the speed of the text typing by changing the interval with events.\n* Use a condition to check if the typing finished.\n* You can also pause the typing and resume it after."
